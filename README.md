**Predictive Analytics Project â€“ eCommerce Review Prediction**

-Collaborated with a team to build a predictive model for "Nile," a leading eCommerce platform, to identify customers likely to leave positive reviews and optimize targeting strategies.

-Applied the CRISP-DM framework to clean, engineer, and analyze a dataset of 8 tables, including customer reviews, order details, and payment records.

-Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, such as the impact of delivery times and payment types on review scores.

-Developed and compared Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Decision Tree (GBDT) models, achieving an F1 score of 0.86 for positive reviews, and recommended actionable insights for deployment.

-Visualized insights (e.g., review score distribution, geographic trends) using Tableau and prepared a technical report and client presentation summarizing findings.
